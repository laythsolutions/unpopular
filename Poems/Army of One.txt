Army of One 
By Leon Guy 

War is raging, attacked on every flank 
Kill or be killed, fighting never stops

Groans of pain, heart is aching
Loses everywhere from every rank

Enemies are plotting forever scheming
Friends turn enemies, some so close

The  will of a warrior never waning
Loyalty so rare, if found don't loose 

Battlefield the heart, soldier the soul
Trenches dark and scary 

My Innocence the casualty
Duty is a duty, I must fulfill my responsibilities

We're all at war, hardly a break 
Enjoy the moment, it's all I've got

Fighting til the end 
Army of One
