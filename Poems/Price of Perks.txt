Price of Perks

Price of being a man 
No one cares
Perks of being a man 
Conquering fears

Handling the pain
Drying your own tears 
Atop the food chain 
Lord alone knows the strain 

Perks of being a man 
Mentally sound physically strong 
Balls of steel, full of zeal
Perks of being a man 

Price is being alone, 
a stranger in every town 
First to be put down, 
Know you're on your own 

Fighting to stay alive, 
Put that pride aside,
Make no difference, 
one who must provide.

Mind of man
Built pyramids and dams
Love that course his veins 
Made drugs that eased the pain

What beats in his chest 
Comes tender caress
Sweetest thing to hear
Dad, you're the best!

Joy of being a man 
Scent of a woman 
Hills and streams 
Moans and screams
