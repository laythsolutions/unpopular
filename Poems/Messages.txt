Read between the lines 
Watch the flipping coin 
Both have  two signs 
Explicit, implied 

Pride myopic by design 
Feeds on the  explicit
Wisdom patient 
Guards  the implicit 

More is said
Hissing the sign
Snakes they slither
Split tongues twist minds

The tossing of the coin 
Flipping in the ear
If it's heads you see
Tails are near

Spaces between the words 
Most have never heard 
Underneath the coin 
Most have never seen 

Attention is the price
Some paid with their lives
Read between the lines 
Watch the flipping coin
