Your Eyes 

When I stared into your eyes 
The girl I saw inside 
fear has made her scared 
Even though I would never dare

I miss the fun we had
The laughs we shared 
Promises that we made
Of love and tender care

Please come out and play 
Brightened up my day
My Sun up in the sky 
Clouds now make me cry
 
Walks in the park
Kisses after dark 
Deep talks and laughter 
Of future sons and daughters 

Sorry for the pain
With intense love came
You're forgiven, my love
Praying you do the same 

loved you 
Very first day 
Can't believe 
You walked
