Goodbye 

selfish I said you were 
I now know I was too
You, not for me...
Me, only for you

A strong man made soft
Lived In my dreams as I slept 
change my mind but not my heart 
love so strong, I wish we never met 

Robbed of life, with a beautiful wife
Kids already named, never to be seen
Can't tell you how much I've missed you 
I have to keep it all within 

Told you I loved you, never lied
My heart couldn't keep it inside 
A message in a bottle
This is my Goodbye.
