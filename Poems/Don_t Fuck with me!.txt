Don't Fuck with me!

Don't fuck with me 
I am him
Chin up, chest out 
Balls Big

Don't play with me 
I'm no toy
A Man's Man
No boy

You love talk
I love to fight
I have done things
Secrets of the night 

Put a bag over your head
Clip your heels like Achilles 
Take your fingers and your eyes 
Take your tongue for your lies

We only have one 
That's our lives
Keep fucking with me 
They're gonna cry
