Warrior Within 

You don't have to win 
Just have to fight!
Find the warrior within 
The darkness of the night 

You may lose, 
but not every round
Each hit taken, 
three blow must return

The spirit of a fighter 
Made in the fire
David and Goliath 
Heart of a Lion 

Give up Never
I believe in me
Against all odds 
victory!
