Wall Against The World 

I am safer against a wall 
than someone at my back 
Though it's just some bricks 
I know I can relax 

Dog fed once will remember you for life
Lifelong friend wouldn't look at you twice
Unreliable, ungrateful, unpredictable man
I turn to You Lord, Most Trustworthy Hand
Forgive me for my sins, You alone know what it has been
Make me strong as only You can outside and within 

Bless me with patience, humility and virility 
Bestow upon me peace, calm and tranquility 
Guide and protect me from myself, friends and enemies 
I forgive all offenses, condemn none to hell on account of me
