For you 
By Leon Guy 

Hate for you this heart
Refuse to keep inside
Love for you was deep
Though t'was kicked aside 

The side of me you knew
No other has ever seen
That hurt brought me low
Love  alone could heal

About myself I've learned 
Had to take a look inside 
My sleeve it lived before 
secret place it now resides 

Both of us will never be
I was stupid to believe 
That you would be with me 
Hurtful words you said to me

Memories of us I'll keep 
The parts that felt so real
Even though I now believe
Us two will never be
