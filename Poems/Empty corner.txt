Empty corner 

A stool to sit, water to sip
Cuts get clean, what a team
Cheers of encouragement 
Word of belief, what a team 

In the heat of the fight
When feeling down 
Listen and take a look around 
End of every round 

Life is twice as hard
Pain you can't believe 
It's all in the mind
Playing all the tricks 

Alone in the ring
The one who's in the fight 
I was made this way 
A predator, not a prey

God give me strength 
Persistence resilience 
Unbreakable belief
In you to be there for me

My mind has grown stronger 
Heart soft and tender 
Lonely days and nights 
Oh I hate to fight 

Peace has evaded me
Trials a constant company 
The ones I love the most 
Always the first to leave 

Expectations disappointments
Hoping for a better day 
Accepting the way things are 
Might be the only way 

I'll cherish whatever I have 
Be grateful throughout the day 
Telling the ones I love
How much they mean to me
