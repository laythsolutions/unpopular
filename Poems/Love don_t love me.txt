Love don't love me

Told you to have my back
In my back you stabbed me 
You asked for vulnerability 
Then exposed my secrets 

When you needed me I was there
When I was in need  you were busy 
When you were down I held your hand 
When I was down you kicked me 

We once were Lovers 
Feels Now more like enemies 
I wish I was more like you 
Maybe then you would love me
