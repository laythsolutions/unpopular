Chess not Checkers 

The boards look the same
The pieces not so much
flat no detail roles are the same
The other formed in ranks

You Cross one, two, three
I Move Bishop C1 to E3
You saw I was down, kicked me
I held your foot and tripped you

What's the matter,
you don't know what happened?
You took four, five and six
My Move, Rook G5 to G6

You took another and another
The end of the board your goal
You don't care how many souls
I Move, pawn D2 to D4

Your moves are sideways 
But first I came straight 
Your aim was to win
Playing against your mate

On the board Sliding right to left 
I watched and read every step 
Move is mine what's next
Your crown is cornered, Check......
