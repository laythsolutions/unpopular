Birth of a King 
By Leon Guy 

Own nothing 
Nothing to lose 
Forget the pain
Lessons peruse 

Born alone 
Death same
Dreams of mine
All to gain 

Moving forward 
Can't go back 
Past in the past 
Future's what's left 

Buried heart 
Unmarked grave
No one will find 
Ever again 

Farewell Prince 
Hail the King 
Storm or siege 
Will never yield

I own nothing 
But each breath 
In each moment 
I live my death
