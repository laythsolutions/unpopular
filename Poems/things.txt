things 

You said it best
It will never work
Without mutual support 

Trust 
It's having confidence 
In your honesty 

Vulnerability 
Please explain 
It's not telling others of our struggles 

Love
What does it mean 
Me being there for you, and you for me

How could I forget 
The role of respect 
I think the most important yet 

All these things
We must dig deep
Pour them as foundation 

Without these things 
Let's not waste 
Each other's precious time 

It's in the struggles 
We build that bond
The future will require 

People are nice
When things are right 
It's in the Storm 
The true us come around 

Without these things 
It will never work 
Without these things 
It will hurt
